Hey there! 👋🏻

Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm excited to share my journey with you - it's a mix of code, real-world tech musings,  a dash of economics-nerdiness, and a whole lot of figuring things out as I go.

My background's in backend engineering (with a soft spot for Python), but after 10+ years in the industry and some time in research, I needed a place to explore it all. Consider this my digital sandbox - and you're welcome to play along!

Let's connect if you like building things, are curious about the tech/economic landscape, or just want to chat. 😊
